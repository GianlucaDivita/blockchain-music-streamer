ABSTRACT: A platform on block chain that mimics a service like Spotify or Apple Music. The logic will have a user deposit a subscription fee and then be able to interact (play music) from an artist (or many). Each iteration is counted and after a given time the subscription fee is paid out in proportion to how many interactions the user has had with each artist. The more interactions mean a larger cut of the subscription payout.
